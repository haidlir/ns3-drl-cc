Profiling
---------

Memory profiling is essential to identify issues that
may cause memory corruption, which may lead to all sorts of
side-effects, such as crashing after many hours of simulation and
producing wrong results that invalidate the entire simulation.

It also can help tracking sources of excessive memory allocations,
the size of these allocations and memory usage during simulation.
These can affect simulation performance, or limit the complexity
and the number of concurrent simulations.

Performance profiling on the other hand is essential for
high-performance applications, as it allows for the identification
of bottlenecks and their mitigation.

Another type of profiling is related to system calls. They
can be used to debug issues and identify hotspots that
may cause performance issues in specific conditions. Excessive
calls results in more context switches, which interrupt the
simulations, ultimately slowing them down.

Other than profiling the simulations, which can highlight bottlenecks
in the simulator, we can also profile the compilation process.
This allows us to identify and fix bottlenecks, which speed up
build times.


Memory Profilers
****************

.. _Sanitizers : https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki
.. _Heaptrack : https://apps.kde.org/heaptrack/
.. _Valgrind: https://valgrind.org/
.. _MacOS's leaks: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/Articles/FindingLeaks.html
.. _Bytehound : https://github.com/koute/bytehound
.. _gperftools : https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools

Memory profilers are tools that help identifying memory related
issues.

There are two well known tools for finding bugs such as uninitialized memory usage,
out-of-bound accesses, dereferencing null pointers and other memory-related bugs:

* `Valgrind`_

  * Pros: very rich tooling, no need to recompile programs to profile the program.
  * Cons: very slow and limited to Linux and MacOS.
* `Sanitizers`_

  * Pros: sanitizers are distributed along with compilers, such as GCC, Clang and MSVC.
    They are widely available, cross platform and faster than Valgrind.
  * Cons: false positives, high memory usage, memory sanitizer is incompatible
    with other sanitizers (e.g. address sanitizer), requiring two instrumented
    compilations and two test runs. The memory sanitizer requires Clang.

There are also tools to count memory allocations, track memory usage and memory leaks,
such as: `Heaptrack`_, `MacOS's leaks`_, `Bytehound`_ and `gperftools`_.

An overview on how to use `Valgrind`_, `Sanitizers`_ and
`Heaptrack`_ is provided in the following sections.

Valgrind
++++++++

.. _manual : https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/mc-manual.html

`Valgrind`_ is suite of profiling tools, being the main tool called Memcheck.
To check for memory errors including leaks, one can call valgrind directly:

.. sourcecode:: console

    valgrind --leak-check=yes ./relative/path/to/program argument1 argument2

Or can use the ``ns3`` script:

.. sourcecode:: console

    ./ns3 run "program argument1 argument2" --valgrind

Additional Valgrind options are listed on its `manual`_.

Sanitizers
++++++++++

`Sanitizers`_ are a suite of libraries made by Google and part of the LLVM project,
used to profile programs at runtime and find issues related to undefined behavior,
memory corruption (out-of-bound access, uninitialized memory use), leaks, race
conditions and others.

Sanitizers are shipped with most modern compilers and can be used by instructing the
compiler to link the required libraries and instrument the code.

To build ns-3 with sanitizers, enable the ``NS3_SANITIZE`` option. This can be done
directly via CMake:

.. sourcecode:: console

    ~/ns-3-dev/cmake_cache/$ cmake -DNS3_SANITIZE=ON ..

Or via the ``ns3`` wrapper:

.. sourcecode:: console

    ~/ns-3-dev$ ./ns3 configure --enable-sanitizers

.. _issue 166 : https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/issues/166
.. _MR703 : https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/merge_requests/703
.. _MR704 : https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/merge_requests/704

The memory sanitizer can be enabled with ``NS3_SANITIZE_MEMORY``, but it is not
compatible with ``NS3_SANITIZE`` and only works with the Clang compiler.

Sanitizers were used to find issues in multiple occasions:

* A global buffer overflow in the LTE module

  * When the wrong index (-1) was used to access a ``int [][]`` variable, a different variable that is stored closely in memory was accessed.
  * In the best case scenario, this results in reading an incorrect value that causes the program to fail
  * In the worst case scenario, this value is overwritten corrupting the program memory
  * The likely scenario: wrong value is read and the program continued running, potentially producing incorrect results

    and a shadow bytes map, showing the wrong access between square brackets.
  * The the global redzone (f9) shadow bytes are empty memory allocated between global variables (00s and 04s),
    which are left there to be corrupted by the bugged program.
    Any eventual corruption is then traced back to the source, without affecting the program execution.
  * The adopted solution in merge request `MR703`_ was to fix one of the schedulers that could produce the index value of -1,
    and updating the asserts to catch the illegal index value.

* A wrong downcast in the Wimax module:

  * The pointer was casted incorrectly to U16TlvValue instead of U8TvlValue, which could have different sizes in memory
    leading to the program reading the wrong memory address.
    Reading the wrong memory address can result in unexpected or invalid values being read, which could change the
    program flow and corrupt memory, producing wrong simulation results or crashing the program.

Heaptrack
+++++++++

.. _KDE : https://kde.org

`Heaptrack`_ is an utility made by `KDE`_ to trace memory allocations
along with stack traces, allowing developers to identify code responsible
for possible memory leaks and unnecessary allocations.

For the examples below we used the default configuration of ns-3,
with the output going to the ``build`` directory. The actual executable
for the ``wifi-he-network`` example is ``./build/examples/wireless/ns3-dev-wifi-he-network``, which is what is
executed by ``./ns3 run wifi-he-network``.

To collect information of a program (in this case the ``wifi-he-network``
example), run:

.. sourcecode:: console

   ~ns-3-dev/$ heaptrack ./build/examples/wireless/ns3-dev-wifi-he-network --simulationTime=0.3 --frequency=5 --useRts=1 --minExpectedThroughput=6 --maxExpectedThroughput=745

If you prefer to use the ``ns3`` wrapper, try:

.. sourcecode:: console

   ~ns-3-dev/$ ./ns3 run "wifi-he-network --simulationTime=0.3 --frequency=5 --useRts=1 --minExpectedThroughput=6 --maxExpectedThroughput=745" --heaptrack --no-build

In both cases, heaptrack will print to the terminal the output file:

.. sourcecode:: console

    ~ns-3-dev/$ ./ns3 run "wifi-he-network --simulationTime=0.3 --frequency=5 --useRts=1 --minExpectedThroughput=6 --maxExpectedThroughput=745" --heaptrack --no-build
    heaptrack output will be written to "~ns-3-dev/heaptrack.ns3-dev-wifi-he-network.210305.zst"
    starting application, this might take some time...

    Heaptrack finished! Now run the following to investigate the data:

        heaptrack --analyze "~/ns-3-dev/heaptrack.ns3-dev-wifi-he-network.210305.zst"

The output above shows a summary of the stats collected: ~149 million allocations,
~21 million temporary allocations and ~10 thousand possible leaked allocations.

If ``heaptrack-gui`` is installed, running ``heaptrack`` will launch it. If it is not installed,
the command line interface will be used.

    peak heap memory consumption: 4.87MB
    peak RSS (including heaptrack overhead): 42.02MB
    total memory leaked: 895.45KB


The terminal output above lists the most frequently called functions that allocated memory.

Here is a short description of what each line of the last block of the output means:

* Allocation functions are all functions that allocated memory, either explicitly
  via C-style ``malloc`` and C++ ``new``, or implicitly via RAII and automatic conversions.

* Temporary memory allocations are allocations that are followed by the
  deallocation without modifying the data.

* Peak heap memory is the maximum memory allocated by the program throughout its execution.
  The memory allocator may reuse memory freed by previous destructors, ``del`` and ``free`` calls,
  reducing the number of system calls and maximum memory allocated.

* RSS is the Resident Set Size, which is the amount of physical memory occupied by the process.

* Total memory leak refers to memory allocated but never freed. This includes static initialization,
  so it is not uncommon to be different than 0KB. However this does not mean the program does not
  have memory leaks. Other memory profilers such as Valgrind and memory sanitizers are better
  suited to track down memory leaks.

Based on the stack trace, it is fairly easy to locate the corresponding code and act on it to
reduce the number of allocations.

.. _MR830 : https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/merge_requests/830

In the case of ``ns3::QueueDisc::DropBeforeEnqueue`` shown above, the
allocations were caused by the transformation of C strings (``char*``) into C++ strings
(std::string) before performing the search in ns3::QueueDisc::Stats maps.
These unnecessary allocations were prevented by making use of the transparent
comparator ``std::less<>``, part of merge request `MR830`_.

Heaptrack also has a GUI that provides the same information printed by the command line interface,
but in a more interactive way.

.. image:: figures/heaptrack.png

Heaptrack was used in merge request `MR830`_ to track and reduce the number of allocations
in the ``wifi-he-network`` example mentioned above. About 29 million unnecessary allocations
were removed, which translates to a 20% reduction. This resulted in a 1.07x speedup of the
test suite with Valgrind (``./test.py -d -g``) and 1.02x speedup without it.


Memray
++++++

.. _Memray : https://bloomberg.github.io/memray/

`Memray`_ is an utility made by Bloomberg to trace memory allocations of Python programs,
including native code called by them. Along with stack traces, developers can trace down
possible memory leaks and unnecessary allocations.

Note: Memray is ineffective for profiling the ns-3 python bindings since Cppyy hides away
the calls to the ns-3 module libraries. However, it is still useful for python scripts
in general, for example ones used to parse and consolidate simulation results.

The ``ns3`` script includes a run option to launch Python programs with Memray.
Memray can produce different types of reports, such as a flamegraph in HTML, or
text reports (``summary`` and ``stats``).

.. sourcecode:: console

    ~/ns-3-dev/$ ./ns3 run sample-rng-plot.py --memray
    Writing profile results into memray.output
    Memray WARNING: Correcting symbol for aligned_alloc from 0x7fd97023c890 to 0x7fd97102fce0
    [memray] Successfully generated profile results.

    You can now generate reports from the stored allocation records.
    Some example commands to generate reports:

    /usr/bin/python3 -m memray flamegraph memray.output
    ~/ns-3-dev$ /usr/bin/python3 -m memray stats memray.output

Performance Profilers

Performance profilers are programs that collect runtime information and help to
identify performance bottlenecks. In some cases, they can point out hotspots
and suggest solutions.

There are many tools to profile your program, including:

* profilers from CPU manufacturers, such as `AMD uProf`_ and `Intel VTune`_
* profilers from the operating systems, such as Linux's `Perf`_ and `Windows Performance Toolkit`_

  * `Perf`_ also has a few graphical user interfaces available, being `Hotspot`_ one of them
* instrumented compilation and auxiliary tools provided by compilers, such as `Gprof`_
* third-party tools, such as `Sysprof`_ and `Oprofile`_

An overview on how to use `Perf`_ with `Hotspot`_, `AMD uProf`_ and
`Intel VTune`_ is provided in the following sections.

.. _Linux Perf and Hotspot GUI :

Linux Perf and Hotspot GUI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`Perf`_ is the kernel tool to measure performance of the Linux kernel,
drivers and user-space applications.

Perf tracks some performance events, being some of the most important for performance:

* cycles

  * Clocks (time) spent running.
* cache-misses

  * When either data or instructions were not in the L1/L2 caches, requiring
    a L3 or memory access.
* branch-misses

  * How many branch instructions were mispredicted.
    Mispredictions causes the CPU to stall and clean the pipeline,
    slowing down the program.
* stalled-cycles-frontend

  * Cycles wasted by the processor waiting for the next instruction,
    usually due to instruction cache miss or mispredictions.
    Starves the CPU pipeline of instructions and slows down the program.
* stalled-cycles-backend

  * Cycles wasted waiting for pipeline resources to finish their work.
    Usually waiting for memory read/write, or executing long-latency instructions.


Just like with ``heaptrack``, perf can be executed using the ``ns3`` wrapper
command template. In the following command we output perf data from ``wifi-he-network``
to the ``perf.data`` output file.

.. sourcecode:: console


    ~/ns-3-dev$ ./ns3 run "wifi-he-network --simulationTime=0.3 --frequency=5 --useRts=1 --minExpectedThroughput=6 --maxExpectedThroughput=745" --command-template "perf record -o ./perf.data --call-graph dwarf --event cycles,cache-misses,branch-misses --sample-cpu %s" --no-build

For ease of use, ``ns3`` also provides the ``--perf`` run option, that
include the recommended settings.

.. sourcecode:: console

    ~/ns-3-dev$ ./ns3 run "wifi-he-network --simulationTime=0.3 --frequency=5 --useRts=1 --minExpectedThroughput=6 --maxExpectedThroughput=745" --perf --no-build

When running for the first time, you may receive the following error:

.. sourcecode:: console

    ~/ns-3-dev$ ./ns3 run "wifi-he-network --simulationTime=0.3 --frequency=5 --useRts=1 --minExpectedThroughput=6 --maxExpectedThroughput=745" --perf --no-build
    Error:
    Access to performance monitoring and observability operations is limited.
    Consider adjusting /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid setting to open
    access to performance monitoring and observability operations for processes
    without CAP_PERFMON, CAP_SYS_PTRACE or CAP_SYS_ADMIN Linux capability.
    More information can be found at 'Perf events and tool security' document:

This error is related to lacking permissions to access performance events from the kernel and CPU.
As said in the error, permissions can be granted for the current session
by changing the ``perf_event_paranoid`` setting with ``echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid``.
This change can be made permanent by changing the setting in ``/etc/sysctl.conf``, but
this is not recommended. Administrative permissions (``sudo su``) are required in both cases.

After the program finishes, it will print recording statistics.

Results saved in ``perf.data`` can be reviewed with the ``perf report`` command.

`Hotspot`_ is a GUI for Perf, that makes performance profiling more
enjoyable and productive. It can parse the ``perf.data`` and show in
a more friendly way.

To record the same perf.data from Hotspot directly, fill the fields
for working directory, path to the executable, arguments, perf
events to track and output directory for the ``perf.data``.
Then run to start recording.

.. image:: figures/hotspot-setup.png

The cycles per function for this program is shown in the following
image.

.. image:: figures/hotspot-cycles.png

The data is also presented in a tabular format in the bottom-up,
top-down and caller/callee tabs (top left of the screen).

.. image:: figures/hotspot-top-down.png

.. _issue 280 : https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/issues/280
.. _issue 426 : https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/issues/426
.. _MR681 : https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/merge_requests/681
.. _MR685 : https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/merge_requests/685

Hotspot was used to identify performance bottlenecks in multiple occasions:

#.  ``wifi-primary-channels`` test suite was extremely slow due to unnecessary RF processing.
    The adopted solution was to replace the filtering step of the entire channel to just the desired
    sub-band, and assuming sub-bands are uniformly sized, saving multiplications in the integral
    used to compute the power of each sub-band. This resulted in a 6x speedup with
    ``./ns3 run "test-runner --fullness=TAKES_FOREVER --test-name=wifi-primary-channels"``.
    Hotspot was used along with AMD uProf to track this and other bottlenecks in `issue 426`_.

#.  ``WifiMacQueue::TtlExceeded`` dereferenced data out of cache when calling Simulator::Now().
    The adopted solution was to move Simulator::Now() out of TtlExceeded and reuse the value
    and inlining TtlExceeded. This resulted in a ~1.20x speedup with the test suite (``./test.py -d``).
    Hotspot was used along with AMD uProf to track this and other bottlenecks in `issue 280`_
    and merge request `MR681`_.

#.  MpduAggregator and MsduAggregator required an expensive attribute lookup to get the maximum sizes
    from the RegularWifiMac. Bypassing the attribute lookup reduced cache misses and unnecessary branches.
    The adopted solution was to move Simulator::Now() out of TtlExceeded and reuse the value
    and inlining TtlExceeded. This resulted in a ~1.02x speedup with the test suite (``./test.py -d``).
    More details on: merge requests `MR681`_ and `MR685`_.


AMD uProf
+++++++++

`AMD uProf`_ works much like `Linux Perf and Hotspot GUI`_, but
is available in more platforms (Linux, Windows and BSD) using AMD
processors. Differently from Perf, it provides more performance
trackers for finer analysis.

To use it, open uProf then click to profile an application. If you
have already profile an application, you can reuse those settings for
another application by clicking in one of the items in the ``Recently Used
Configurations`` section.

.. image:: figures/uprof-start.png

Fill the fields with the application path, the arguments and
the working directory.

You may need to add the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
(or PATH on Windows), pointing it to the library output
directory (e.g. ``ns-3-dev/build/lib``).

Then click next:

.. image:: figures/uprof-profile-application.png

Now select custom events and pick the events you want.

The recommended ones for performance profiling are:
 * CYCLES_NOT_IN_HALT

   * Clocks (time) spent running.
 * RETIRED_INST

   * How many instructions were completed.
   * These do not count mispredictions, stalls, etc.
   * Instructions per clock (IPC) = RETIRED_INST / CYCLES_NOT_IN_HALT
 * RETIRED_BR_INST_MISP

   * How many branch instructions were mispredicted.
   * Mispredictions causes the CPU to stall and clean the pipeline,
     slowing down the program.
 * L2_CACHE_MISS.FROM_L1_IC_MISS

   * L2 cache misses caused by instruction L1 cache misses.
   * Results in L3/memory accesses due to missing instructions in L1/L2.
 * L2_CACHE_MISS.FROM_L1_DC_MISS

   * L2 cache misses caused by data L1 cache misses.
   * Results in L3/memory accesses due to missing instructions in L1/L2
 * MISALIGNED_LOADS

   * Loads not aligned with processor words.
   * Might result in additional cache and memory accesses.

.. image:: figures/uprof-select-events.png

Now click in advanced options to enable collection of the call stack.

.. image:: figures/uprof-collect-callstack.png

Then click ``Start Profile`` and wait for the program to end.
After it finishes you will be greeted with a hotspot summary screen,
but the ``Analyze`` tab (top of the screen) has sub-tabs with more
relevant information.

In the following image the metrics are shown per module, including the
C library (libc.so.6) which provides the ``malloc`` and ``free`` functions.
Values can be shown in terms of samples or percentages for easier reading
and to decide where to optimize.

.. _semantic interposition: https://maskray.me/blog/2021-05-09-fno-semantic-interposition

Here are a few cases where AMD uProf was used to identify performance bottlenecks:

#.  ``WifiMacQueue::TtlExceeded`` dereferenced data out of cache when calling Simulator::Now().
    The adopted solution was to move Simulator::Now() out of TtlExceeded and reuse the value
    and inlining TtlExceeded. This resulted in a ~1.20x speedup with the test suite (``./test.py -d``).
    More details on: `issue 280`_ and merge request `MR681`_.

#.  ``wifi-primary-channels`` test suite was extremely slow due to unnecessary RF processing.
    The adopted solution was to replace the filtering step of the entire channel to just the desired
    sub-band, and assuming sub-bands are uniformly sized, saving multiplications in the integral
    used to compute the power of each sub-band. This resulted in a 6x speedup with
    ``./ns3 run "test-runner --fullness=TAKES_FOREVER --test-name=wifi-primary-channels"``.
    More details on: `issue 426`_ and merge request `MR677`_.

#.  Continuing the work on ``wifi-primary-channels`` test suite, profiling showed an excessive
    number of cache misses in ``InterferenceHelper::GetNextPosition``.
    This function searches for an iterator on a map, which is very fast
    if the map is small and fits in the cache, which was not the case. After reviewing the code,
    it was noticed in most cases this call was unnecessary as the iterator was already known.
    The adopted solution was to reuse the iterator whenever possible.
    This resulted in a 1.78x speedup on top of the previous 6x with
    ``./ns3 run "test-runner --fullness=TAKES_FOREVER --test-name=wifi-primary-channels"``.
    More details on: `issue 426`_ and merge requests `MR677`_ and `MR680`_.

#.  Position-Independent Code libraries (``-fPIC``) have an additional layer of indirection that increases
    instruction cache misses. The adopted solution was to disable `semantic interposition`_ with flag
    ``-fno-semantic-interposition`` on GCC. This is the default setting on Clang. This results in
    approximately 1.14x speedup with ``./test.py -d``. More details on: `MR777`_.

Note: all speedups above were measured on the same machine. Results may differ based on clock speeds,
cache sizes, number of cores, memory bandwidth and latency, storage throughput and latency.

Intel VTune
+++++++++++

`Intel VTune`_ works much like `Linux Perf and Hotspot GUI`_, but
is available in more platforms (Linux, Windows and Mac) using Intel
processors. Differently from Perf, it provides more performance
trackers for finer analysis.

When you open the program, you will be greeted by the landing page
shown in the following image. To start a new profiling project, click
in the ``Configure Analysis`` button. If you already have a project,
right-click the entry and click to configure analysis to reuse the
settings.

.. image:: figures/vtune-landing.png

A configuration page will open, where you can fill the fields with
the path to the program, arguments, and set working directory and
environment variables.

Note: in this example on Windows using MinGW,
we need to define the ``PATH`` environment variable with the paths
to both ``~/ns-3-dev/build/lib`` and the MinGW binaries folder
(``~/msys64/mingw64/bin``), which contains essential libraries.
On Linux-like systems you will need to define the
``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable instead of ``PATH``.

Clicking on the ``Performance Snapshot`` shows the different profiling
options.

.. image:: figures/vtune-configure.png

If executed as is, a quicker profiling will be executed to
determine what areas should be profiled with more details.
For the specific example, it is indicated that there are
microarchitectural bottlenecks and low parallelism
(not a surprise since ns-3 is single-threaded).

.. image:: figures/vtune-perf-snapshot.png

If the ``microarchitecture exploration`` option is selected, cycles,
branch mispredictions, cache misses and other metrics will be collected.

.. image:: figures/vtune-select-uarch-profiling.png

After executing the ``microarchitecture exploration``, a summary will
be shown. Hovering the mouse over the red flags will explain what
each sentence means and how it impacts performance.

.. image:: figures/vtune-uarch-profiling-summary.png

Clicking in the ``Bottom-up`` tab shows all the information per module.
A plethora of stats such as CPU time, instructions retired,
retiring percentage (how many of the dispatched instructions
were executed until the end, usually lower than 100% because of branch
mispredictions), bad speculation, cache misses, unused load ports,
and more.

The stats for the wifi module are shown below. The retiring
metric indicates about 40% of dispatched instructions are
executed. The diagram on the right shows the bottleneck is
in the front-end of the pipeline (red), due to high
instruction cache misses, translation lookaside buffer (TLB)
overhead and unknown branches (most likely callbacks).

.. image:: figures/vtune-uarch-wifi-stats.png

The stats for the core module are shown below.
More specifically for the ns3::Object::DoGetObject function.
Metrics indicates about 63% of bad speculations.
The diagram on the right shows that there are bottlenecks
both in the front-end and due to bad speculation (red).

System calls profilers
**********************

.. _dtrace : https://github.com/opendtrace/documentation
.. _strace : https://strace.io/
.. _procmon : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon

System call profilers collect information on which system
calls were made by a program, how long they took to be
fulfilled and how many of them resulted in errors.

There are many system call profilers, including `dtrace`_, `strace`_ and `procmon`_.

An overview on how to use `strace`_ is provided in the following section.

Strace
++++++


The `strace`_ is a system calls (syscalls) profiler for Linux. It can filter
specific syscalls, or gather stats during the execution.

To collect statistics, use ``strace -c``:

.. sourcecode:: console

    ~ns-3-dev/$ ./ns3 run "wifi-he-network --simulationTime=0.3 --frequency=5 --useRts=1 --minExpectedThroughput=6 --maxExpectedThroughput=745" --command-template "strace -c %s" --no-build
    MCS value               Channel width           GI                      Throughput
    0                       20 MHz                  3200 ns                 5.91733 Mbit/s
    ...
    11                      160 MHz                 800 ns                  524.459 Mbit/s
    % time     seconds  usecs/call     calls    errors syscall
    ------ ----------- ----------- --------- --------- ----------------
     37.62    0.004332          13       326       233 openat
     35.46    0.004083           9       415           mmap
    ...
    ------ ----------- ----------- --------- --------- ----------------
    100.00    0.011515           8      1378       251 total

In the example above, the syscalls are listed in the right, after
the time spent on each syscall, number of calls and errors.

The errors can be caused due to multiple reasons and may not
be a problem. To check if they were problems, strace can log the
syscalls with ``strace -o calls.log``:

.. sourcecode:: console

    ~ns-3-dev/$ ./ns3 run "wifi-he-network --simulationTime=0.3 --frequency=5 --useRts=1 --minExpectedThroughput=6 --maxExpectedThroughput=745" --command-template "strace -o calls.log %s" --no-build
    MCS value               Channel width           GI                      Throughput
    0                       20 MHz                  3200 ns                 5.91733 Mbit/s
    ...
    11                      160 MHz                 800 ns                  524.459 Mbit/s


Looking at the ``calls.log`` file, we can see different sections. In the
following section, the example is executed (``execve``), architecture is checked (``arch_prctl``),
memory is mapped for execution (``mmap``) and LD_PRELOAD use is checked.

.. sourcecode:: console

    access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

Then the program searches for the wifi module library and fails multiple times (the errors seen in the table above).

.. sourcecode:: console

    openat(AT_FDCWD, "~/ns-3-dev/build/lib/glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v3/libns3-dev-wifi.so", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

    newfstatat(AT_FDCWD, "~/ns-3-dev/build/lib/x86_64", 0x7ffff8d62c80, 0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

The library is finally found and its header is read:

.. sourcecode:: console

    openat(AT_FDCWD, "~/ns-3-dev/build/lib/libns3-dev-wifi.so", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
    read(3, "\177ELF\2\1\1\3\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0>\0\1\0\0\0py\30\0\0\0\0\0"..., 832) = 832

Then other modules that wifi depends on are loaded, then execution of the program continues to the main
function of the simulation.

Strace was used to track down issues found while running the ``lena-radio-link-failure`` example.
Its ``strace -c`` table was the following:

Notice the number of ``openat``, ``write``, ``close`` and ``lseek`` calls
are much more frequent than the other calls. These mean
``lena-radio-link-failure`` is opening, then seeking, then writing,
then closing at least one file handler.

Using ``strace``, we can easily find the most frequently used file handlers.

.. _MR814: https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/merge_requests/814

With the name of the files, we can look at the code that manipulates them.

The issue above was found in `MR777`_, were performance for some LTE examples
regressed for no apparent reason. The flame graph below, produced by `AMD uProf`_,
contains four large columns/"flames" in red, which
correspond to the ``write``, ``openat``, ``close`` and ``lseek`` syscalls.

.. image:: figures/uprof-strace-lte.png

Upon closer inspection, these syscalls take a long time to complete due to
the underlying filesystem of the machine running the example (NTFS mount
using the ntfs-3g FUSE filesystem). In other words, the bottleneck only
exists when running the example in slow file systems
(e.g. FUSE and network file systems).

The merge request `MR814`_ addressed the issue by keeping the files open
throughout the simulation. That alone resulted in a 1.75x speedup.


Compilation Profilers
*********************

Compilation profilers can help identifying which steps of the compilation
are slowing it down. These profilers are built into the compilers themselves,
only requiring third-party tools to consolidate the results.

The GCC feature is mentioned and exemplified, but is not the recommended
compilation profiling method. For that, Clang is recommended.

GCC
+++

.. _not a priority : https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=92396

GCC has a special flag ``-ftime-report``, which makes it print a table
with time spent per compilation phase for each compiled file. The printed
output for a file is shown below. The line of ``---`` was inserted for clarity.

In the table above, the first few lines show the five main compilations steps: ``setup``,
``parsing``, ``lang. deferred`` (C++ specific transformations),
``opt(imize) and generate (code)``, ``last asm`` (produce binary code).

The lines below the ``---`` line show sub-steps of the five main compilation steps.
For this specific case, parsing global definitions (21%) and structures (16%),
``template instantiation`` (16%) and generating the code in ``symout`` (10%).

Aggregating the data into a meaningful output to help focus where to improve is not that easy
and it is `not a priority`_ for GCC developers.

It is recommended to use the Clang alternative.

Clang
+++++

.. _ClangBuildAnalyzer : https://github.com/aras-p/ClangBuildAnalyzer

Clang can output very similar results with the ``-ftime-trace`` flag, but can also aggregate
it in a more meaningful way. With the help of the third-party tool `ClangBuildAnalyzer`_,
we can have really good insights on where to spend time trying to speed up the compilation.

Support for building with ``-ftime-trace``, compiling `ClangBuildAnalyzer`_ and producing a
report for the project have been baked into the CMake project of ns-3, and can be enabled
with ``-DNS3_CLANG_TIMETRACE=ON``.

.. sourcecode:: console

  ~/ns-3-dev/cmake_cache$ cmake -DNS3_CLANG_TIMETRACE=ON ..

Or via ``ns3``:

.. sourcecode:: console

  ~/ns-3-dev$ ./ns3 configure -- -DNS3_CLANG_TIMETRACE=ON

The entire procedure looks like the following:

.. sourcecode:: console

  ~/ns-3-dev$ CXX="clang++" ./ns3 configure -d release --enable-examples --enable-tests -- -DNS3_CLANG_TIMETRACE=ON
  ~/ns-3-dev$ ./ns3 build timeTraceReport

The output printed out contain a summary of time spent on parsing and on code generation, along
with multiple lists for different tracked categories. From the summary, it is clear that parsing times
are very high when compared to the optimization time (``-O3``). Skipping the others categories and going straight
to the expensive headers section, we can better understand why parsing times are so high, with some headers
adding as much as 5 minutes of CPU time to the parsing time.

.. _drastically speed up parsing times : https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/merge_requests/731#note_687176503

Precompiled headers (``-DNS3_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS=ON``) can `drastically speed up parsing times`_,
however, they can increase ccache misses, reducing the time of the first
compilation at the cost of increasing recompilation times.


CMake Profiler
**************

CMake has a built-in tracer that permits tracking hotspots in the CMake files slowing down the
project configuration. To use the tracer, call cmake directly from a clean CMake cache directory:

.. sourcecode:: console

  ~/ns-3-dev/cmake-cache$ cmake .. --profiling-format=google-trace --profiling-output=../cmake_performance_trace.log


Or using the ns3 wrapper:

.. sourcecode:: console

  ~/ns-3-dev$ ./ns3 configure --trace-performance


.. _Perfetto UI: https://ui.perfetto.dev/

A ``cmake_performance_trace.log`` file will be generated in the ns-3-dev directory.
The tracing results can be visualized using the ``about:tracing`` panel available
in Chromium-based browsers or a compatible trace viewer such as `Perfetto UI`_.

After opening the trace file, select the traced process and click on
any of the blocks to inspect the different stacks and find hotspots.
An auxiliary panel containing the function/macro name, arguments
and location can be shown, providing enough information to trace
back the location of each specific call.

Just like in performance profilers, visual inspection makes it easier
to identify hotspots and focus on trying to optimize what matters most.

.. _issue #588: https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/issues/588

The trace below was generated during the discussion of `issue #588`_,
while investigating the long configuration times, especially when using HDDs.

The single largest contributor was CMake's ``configure_file``, used to keeping
up-to-date copies of headers in the output directory.

.. image:: figures/perfetto-trace-cmake.png


.. _MR911: https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/merge_requests/911

In `MR911`_, alternatives such as stub headers that include the original header
files, keeping them in their respective modules, and symlinking headers to the
output directory were used to reduce the configuration overhead.

Note: when testing I/O bottlenecks, you may want to drop filesystem caches,
otherwise the cache may hide the issues. In Linux, the caches can be cleared
using the following command:

.. sourcecode:: console

  ~/ns-3-dev$ sudo sysctl vm.drop_caches=3
