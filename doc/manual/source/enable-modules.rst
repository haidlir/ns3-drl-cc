Enabling Subsets of |ns3| Modules
---------------------------------

As with most software projects, |ns3| is ever growing larger in terms of number of modules, lines of code, and memory footprint.  Users, however, may only use a few of those modules at a time.  For this reason, users may want to explicitly enable only the subset of the possible |ns3| modules that they actually need for their research.

This chapter discusses how to enable only the |ns3| modules that you are interested in using.

How to enable a subset of |ns3|'s modules
*****************************************

If shared libraries are being built, then enabling a module will cause at least one library to be built:

.. sourcecode:: text

  libns3-modulename.so

If the module has a test library and test libraries are being built, then

.. sourcecode:: text

  libns3-modulename-test.so

will be built, too.  Other modules that the module depends on and their test libraries will also be built.

By default, all modules are built in |ns3|.  There are two ways to enable a subset of these modules:

#. Using ns3's --enable-modules option
#. Using the |ns3| configuration file

Enable modules using ns3's --enable-modules option
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To enable only the core module with example and tests, for example,
try these commands: ::

  $ ./ns3 clean
  $ ./ns3 configure --enable-examples --enable-tests --enable-modules=core
  $ ./ns3 build
  $ cd build/lib
  $ ls

and the following libraries should be present:

.. sourcecode:: text

  libns3-core.so
  libns3-core-test.so

Note the ``./ns3 clean`` step is done here only to make it more obvious which module libraries were built.  You don't have to do ``./ns3 clean`` in order to enable subsets of modules.

Running test.py will cause only those tests that depend on module core to be run:

.. sourcecode:: text

  24 of 24 tests passed (24 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed, 0 crashed, 0 valgrind errors)

Repeat the above steps for the "network" module instead of the "core" module, and the following will be built, since network depends on core:

.. sourcecode:: text

  libns3-core.so       libns3-network.so
  libns3-core-test.so  libns3-network-test.so

Running test.py will cause those tests that depend on only the core and network modules to be run:

.. sourcecode:: text

  31 of 31 tests passed (31 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed, 0 crashed, 0 valgrind errors)

Enable modules using the |ns3| configuration file
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A configuration file, .ns3rc, has been added to |ns3| that allows users to specify which modules are to be included in the build.

When enabling a subset of |ns3| modules, the precedence rules are as follows:

#. the --enable-modules configure string overrides any .ns3rc file
#. the .ns3rc file in the top level |ns3| directory is next consulted, if present
#. the system searches for ~/.ns3rc if the above two are unspecified

If none of the above limits the modules to be built, all modules that CMake knows about will be built.

The maintained version of the .ns3rc file in the |ns3| source code repository resides in the ``utils`` directory.  The reason for this is if it were in the top-level directory of the repository, it would be prone to accidental checkins from maintainers that enable the modules they want to use.  Therefore, users need to manually copy the .ns3rc from the ``utils`` directory to their preferred place (top level directory or their home directory) to enable persistent modular build configuration.

Assuming that you are in the top level |ns3| directory, you can get a copy of the .ns3rc file that is in the ``utils`` directory as follows: ::

    $ cp utils/.ns3rc .

The .ns3rc file should now be in your top level |ns3| directory, and it contains the following:

.. sourcecode:: cmake

    # A list of the modules that will be enabled when ns-3 is run.
    # Modules that depend on the listed modules will be enabled also.
    #
    # All modules can be enabled by emptying the list.
    set(ns3rc_enabled_modules)

    # A list of the modules that will be disabled when ns-3 is run.
    # Modules that depend on the listed modules will be disabled also.
    #
    # If the list is empty, no module will be disabled.
    set(ns3rc_disabled_modules)

    # Set this equal to ON if you want examples to be run.
    set(ns3rc_examples_enabled OFF)

    # Set this equal to ON if you want tests to be run.
    set(ns3rc_tests_enabled OFF)

    # Override other ns-3 settings by setting their values below
    # Note: command-line settings will also be overridden.
    #set(NS3_LOG ON)

Use your favorite editor to modify the .ns3rc file to only enable the core module with examples and tests like this:

.. sourcecode:: cmake

    # A list of the modules that will be enabled when ns-3 is run.
    # Modules that depend on the listed modules will be enabled also.
    #
    # All modules can be enabled by emptying the list.
    set(ns3rc_enabled_modules core)

    # A list of the modules that will be disabled when ns-3 is run.
    # Modules that depend on the listed modules will be disabled also.
    #
    # If the list is empty, no module will be disabled.
    set(ns3rc_disabled_modules)

    # Set this equal to ON if you want examples to be run.
    set(ns3rc_examples_enabled ON)

    # Set this equal to ON if you want tests to be run.
    set(ns3rc_tests_enabled ON)

    # Override other ns-3 settings by setting their values below
    # Note: command-line settings will also be overridden.
    #set(NS3_LOG ON)

Only the core module will be enabled now if you try these commands: ::

  $ ./ns3 clean
  $ ./ns3 configure
  $ ./ns3 build
  $ cd build/lib/
  $ ls

and the following libraries should be present:

.. sourcecode:: text

  libns3-core.so
  libns3-core-test.so

Note the ``./ns3 clean`` step is done here only to make it more obvious which module libraries were built.  You don't have to do ``./ns3 clean`` in order to enable subsets of modules.

Running test.py will cause only those tests that depend on module core to be run:

.. sourcecode:: text

  24 of 24 tests passed (24 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed, 0 crashed, 0 valgrind errors)

Repeat the above steps for the "network" module instead of the "core" module, and the following will be built, since network depends on core:

.. sourcecode:: text

  libns3-core.so       libns3-network.so
  libns3-core-test.so  libns3-network-test.so

Running test.py will cause those tests that depend on only the core and network modules to be run:

.. sourcecode:: text

  31 of 31 tests passed (31 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed, 0 crashed, 0 valgrind errors)
